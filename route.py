# Ref:- http://www.interactivepython.org;refered for understanding how to create/use the graph DS
#
#1. Formulation of problem:
#
#       a) Formulation of the search problem: 
#
#               State-Space representation: For this problem-set, we created a graph which comprises a dictionary containing key-value pairs #               of city names and city objects. Each city object has the properties: city name, co-ordinates and a dictionary of child-cities.
#               Each child-city dictionary has the key as the name of the child-city and values comprise a list of distance, speed-limit and #               highway name.
# 
#               Algorithm implementation: For BFS and DFS, we have used a queue and stack datastructure respectively. For A-star, we are #               using dictionaries for priority queues. For all algorithms, we are using dictionaries to store the paths travesed and time #               required for all paths and distance covered with each path  
#
#       b) State Space: The state space is represented by a the total number of cities provided in the input files
#
#       c) Successor Function: Successor function is the action of moving from a city (object) to any of its child nodes (other city object).
#          Successor function chooses the next state basis the routing algorithm being implemented
#
#       d) Edge Weights: For A-Star, the edge weights can be the distance between consecutive cities, or the time required to travel or can be #          uniform if number of edges are to be considered
#  
#       e) Heuristic Function: Here, we have chosen Euclidean distance as our heuristic function. We found it to yield more accurate results 
#          as compared to manhattan distance. 
#
#       f) Heuristic Admissibility: Euclidean distance, is the shortest path from the start state to the goal state (straight line).
#          Therefore, it will always be equal or less than the optimal path cost. Therefore, it is an admissible heuristic 
#
#2. Assumptions/Design Decisions:        
#
#       a. For junctions, since co-ordinates are not present, we are using the heuristic for the parent city
#       b. Traversing consecutive junctions is made possible
#	c. Junction nodes cannot be goal-states since they do not have co-ordinates
#       d. Travelling on edges with null speed limits is de-incentivized using a greater heuristic for these paths 
#       e. For A-Star, dictionary is used for a priority queue
#       f. For maintaining path costs and time costs which are required for A-Star, dictionaries are used where the key being used
#          is a string comprising the actual path
#           
#3. Analysis of results: 
#
# 	a) Best algorithm for routing options:
#		A-star is the best algorithm for routing, generally it peforms far better than BFS and DFS. In terms of computation time
#               over longer distances, the # performance of A-star is acceptable as both BFS and DFS will take a very long time. BFS will     
#               outperform A-Star only over very short distances. Performance of DFS is acceptable only in case the goal-node is 
#               very close to the start-node.  
#         		
#       b) Fastest in terms of computing time and how much:
#               For shorter distances,BFS is faster than A-Star. BFS runs 2-3 times as fast for cities up to two nodes away. But as we increase
#               the distance to goal cities, time performance of A-Star increases exponentially relative to BFS. DFS behaves similar to BFS  #               but only for goal nodes that are very close to the starting node both alphabetically and in terms of node depth. For a #               goal-state at a greater depth, DFS will return a faster result only if it is alphabetically sorted. 
#               
#               Find a snapshot of the average times for computation required here:
#                    Bloomington-Cincinnati:   0.00034 sec(A-Star_dist) | 0.00010 sec(BFS) |  0.0001 sec(DFS) 
#                    Bloomington-Cloverdale:   0.00090 sec(A-Star_dist) | 0.00044 sec(BFS) |  (lot of time)(DFS)
#                    Bloomington-Indianapolis: 0.0012  sec(A-Star_dist) | 0.00047 sec(BFS) |  (lot of time)(DFS)
#                    Bloomington-Chicago:      0.24    sec(A-Star_dist) | (1min +)(BFS)    |  (lot of time)(DFS)
#		     Bloomington-Seattle:      4.12    sec(A-Star_dist) | (1min +)(BFS)    |  (lot of time)(DFS)
#
#       c) Hueristic function used and how to make it better:
#               Heuristic being used here is the Euclidean distance. We preferred it over Manhattan distance since it yielded more accuracy.  
#               We think that since this heuristic is admissible and is suitable to the graph search being performed it is quite optimal.      
#               One way of improving the heuristic can be including the element of orthogonality over greater distances like San-Diego to 
#               Nova Scotia. So, the heuristic of a Great-Circle Distance may be used in case of larger distances while Euclidean distance is #               used over shorter ones.
